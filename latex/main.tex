\begin{abstract}
We present NotefullBook OS, a personal AI operating layer for thought built on the Forgetting Core Thinking (FCT) framework. Instead of treating memory as perfect archival storage, FCT defines intelligence as the outcome of systematic forgetting, schema survival, and meaning transformation. We outline the cognitive theory, describe the system architecture, and argue that a forgetting-native OS yields privacy by design and a safer alignment between human and artificial cognition.
