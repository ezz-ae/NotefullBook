\section{Introduction}

Modern AI systems are built on an implicit assumption of perfect memory: models, logs, and databases are designed to remember everything. This clashes with human cognition, which depends on forgetting to maintain stability, extract meaning, and preserve psychological health.

NotefullBook OS proposes a different operating principle. Instead of competing with human memory, it completes it. The system is designed as a personal AI thought engine that mirrors the way humans actually think: events erode into patterns, patterns into schemas, and schemas into durable meanings.
