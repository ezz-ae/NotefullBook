\section{Forgetting Core Thinking (FCT)}

The Forgetting Core Thinking framework treats forgetting as the primary engine of intelligence. Rather than modeling recall as replay of stored data, FCT defines recall as reconstruction from surviving schemas.

We summarize the core dependency chain as:
\[
\text{Events} \rightarrow \text{Erosion} \rightarrow \text{Pattern} \rightarrow \text{Schema} \rightarrow \text{Meaning} \rightarrow \text{Logic} \rightarrow \text{Intelligence}.
\]

This chain encodes the idea that intelligence emerges only when details decay. We also introduce the notions of Fade-In Transformation, schema survival, and recall-as-recomputation, which together define how a forgetting-native system must manage memory.
