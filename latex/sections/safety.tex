\section{Safety by Architecture}

Because NotefullBook OS learns from behavioral signals instead of content, it achieves privacy by design. There is no need to crawl notes, emails, or messages. Instead, the system watches what the user returns to, how often, and how ideas drift.

This yields a notion of \emph{cognitive parity}: the AI becomes a completing intelligence rather than a competing one. It respects decay, drift, and rediscovery, and therefore remains structurally aligned with the user instead of attempting to outgrow or dominate them.
