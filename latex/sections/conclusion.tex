\section{Conclusion}

FCT and NotefullBook OS suggest that the next layer of AI progress is not better prediction over more data, but better forgetting over longer time. By encoding forgetting and schema survival into the core of the architecture, we obtain systems that are safer, more private, and more human-compatible.

Future work includes formalizing the behavioral metrics, implementing reference deployments of the CLB and SINLM, and evaluating cognitive load, trust, and long-term stability in real users.
