\section{System Architecture}

NotefullBook OS is organized around a Cognitive Lighting Backend (CLB) and three key modules: the Schema Intelligence Network Learning Mechanism (SINLM), the Forgetting Artifact Module (AFA), and the Cognitive Simplification Engine (CSE).

The CLB activates nodes on demand, mapping associations instead of files. SINLM observes behavioral signals---frequency, return-rate, drift, and persistence---to compute schema survival scores without inspecting content. AFA and CSE work together to erode raw data into artifacts and to simplify the cognitive space.

Figure~\ref{fig:clb-loop} sketches the closed loop: activation, observation, decay, and simplification.
