# NotefullBook OS – Architecture Notes

This document sketches how to extend this research repo into a full-use ecosystem:

- Add APIs and SDKs for clients (mobile, desktop, browser extension).
- Implement the Cognitive Lighting Backend (CLB) as a service.
- Implement SINLM, AFA, and CSE as independent, testable modules.
- Connect to a notebook UI (NotefullBook app) as the primary human interface.

Use this as a scratchpad for engineering decisions, migration plans, and ecosystem diagrams.
